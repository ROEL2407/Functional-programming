## Where is this repository for?
This repository is for my lessons from tech track from the education Communication and Multimedia Design from the HvA. 

## What's the goal of this repository?
In this repository I've cleaned up a dataset that me and my fellow students filled in. The main goal of this repository is to learn how to clean data using functional programming patterns. Later in another course from the tech track this data will be used to create a data visualisation with d3.
